# word-search-project

Hey,
Welcome to my word-search project, the finished result of a computer science class assignment I had. This in-depth word search program already has a considerable amount of notation and the instructions are straightforward and almost adhere to the normal version of the game, differing in the fact that the program does not search diagonally in any direction for the word. 

Input required:
THe input required is a list of words for the program to find and a 100-character string that the program will split into a 10 X 10 grid to search for words. Example inputs may be found in the given text files

Output given:
THe output given is a list of the positions of every word in the list (or a specific notation if it isn't in the list) by the row and column number of the first letter in the word, as well as the direction the word was found facing (up, down, forward, backward)

Have fun!

Sincerely,
Eeshan Mishra
